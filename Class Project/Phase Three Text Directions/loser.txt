Open the "Game" class and run the program.
Click "Start Game"
Open the console and look at the row labeled "Envelope:" 
Click on "Make Accusation" in the GUI and select any three cards not in the
envelope.
A message stating that the player's guess was incorrect and that they have been 
removed from the game will appear.
Click "End Turn" and click "Choose not to move this turn" for each subsequent 
character until you return to Miss Scarlet. The only option available to this player
is now "End Turn", showing that they can no longer participate in the game.
Now, in order to show that Miss Scarlet can still disprove, continue
clicking "Choose not to move this turn" until you arrive at Professor Plum.
Roll the dice for Professor Plum until you are able to enter a room. Make a 
suggestion that includes any of the cards in Miss Scarlet's hand (printed in the
console). The game will show that the suggestion was disproved by Miss Scarlet.
