User stories worked upon but not completed since last meeting:

The user story worked on since last meeting was:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
Our group began working on a move method that can move the player throughout the board.
We decided that players should be able to move through hallways, not move though walls, 
not move where other players are, and be able to enter a room if they reach a doorway.
We created a move method based upon that and then began writing the specific tests needed 
to complete the first user story.


Goals for the next meeting:

The user story we will work on next meeting is:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
To complete this user story we need to finish writing the test methods. When 
we can get all test methods to pass the user story will be complete.


Schedule for the next week's set of pair programming meetings:

The next meeting will take place on October 4th.
The user story to be worked on is:
