User stories worked upon but not completed since last meeting:

The user story worked on since last meeting was:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
Our group began thinking how we are going to create the board in which the players move.
We began to think what would represent the board. The best idea we thought of to represent the 
game board was to use a two-dimensional array.


Goals for the next meeting:

The user story we will work on next meeting is:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
To complete this user story we will have to implement are two-D array. The game board
is composed of more than just players so next meeting we will think of a way to allow 
are board to have, not only players, but other things, as well.
