User stories worked upon but not completed since last meeting:

The user story worked on since last meeting was:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
Our group began thinking how we can have more than just players on the board. 
We then decided to create a BoardObject superclass, have any object that will go on 
the board extend BoardObject, and make are BoardObject array. We also decided the objects 
to go on the board will be players, doorways, hallways, and walls. Also we created the board
and initialized all elements using for loops.


Goals for the next meeting:

The user story we will work on next meeting is:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
To complete this user story we have to create a move method. Now that we have the board
set up we can work on a move method that will move the player throughout the board.


Schedule for the next week's set of pair programming meetings:

The next meeting will take place on September 27th.
The user story to be worked on is 
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
