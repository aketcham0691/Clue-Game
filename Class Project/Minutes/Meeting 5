The user story completed since last meeting was:
As a player, I want to know whether a move breaks the rules of the game.
Our group finished writing the tests for the move method and tested them. 
All tests passed so we completed the first user story and began working on the 
second user story.

User stories worked upon but not completed since last meeting:

The user story worked on since last meeting was:
As a player, I want to know the player who will show me a card proving my suggestion is false.
Our group began thinking how to complete the second user story. We decided the best way would be to make
a Card superclass, and have different card classes (i.e. weapon, room, character) extend Card.  


Goals for the next meeting:

The user story we will work on next meeting is:
As a player, I want to know the player who will show me a card proving my suggestion is false.
To complete this user story we need to continue working on are card subclasses.


Schedule for the next week's set of pair programming meetings:

The user story to be worked on is:
As a player, I want to know the player who will show me a card proving my suggestion is false.
