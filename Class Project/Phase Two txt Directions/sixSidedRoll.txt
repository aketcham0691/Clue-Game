Open the Game class and run the program. Click on "Start Game!" 
For the player whose turn it is (Miss Scarlet is first), a roll button will appear. Click this button to generate a 
random dice roll and a picture (in the bottom right) of the number rolled. The board will highlight the available spaces.
Once you end your turn, the next player's turn will begin and you can once again click "roll".
