Open the Game class and run the program. Click on "Start Game!" 
Click the roll button and the board will highlight your available moves. Click on any of these spaces to see your
character move to this space. Clicking on any wall (black space), player, or space not highlighted by the program will 
result in no activity. Clicking on a highlighted space that was previously a grey space (doorway) will put the character in 
that room. 

Continue playing until you place one player in a corner room (this can go quickly if you choose the "Choose not to move
this turn" button). That character will then have the "Use Passageway" button. Clicking on this button will put the player
in the appropriate room.

You can verify that players appear in the appropriate room by looking at the console. The members of each room will be 
printed each time the player clicks "End Turn."
