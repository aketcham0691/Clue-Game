*Explain how to see the name of the next player and the card disproving a suggestion when the next player holds a card 
disproving suggestion:

Look at the cards that each character has (printed in the console). Select a card that the player after the one selected 
above has in his/her hand. Choose any other card. Submit this as your guess and the player and the card disproving 
will appear.

*Explain how to see the name of the player-after-next and the card disproving a suggestion when the next player 
cannot disprove a suggestion, but the player-after-next can:

Repeat the steps above, this time choosing a card that the player-after-next has in his/her hand. You must also NOT choose
any card in the hand of the player after the one making the suggestion.

*Explain how to see the name of the player BEFORE the player making the suggestion and the card disproving a 
suggestion when only they have a card disproving a suggestion:

Repeat the steps above, this time choosing a card that the player prior to the player selected above has in 
his/her hand. Your other guesses should be the card in the envelope.

*Explain how to see that nobody could disprove the suggestion when only the suggesting player can disprove the suggestion:

This time, make a suggestion that includes any card in your hand and the other two cards in the envelope. The player
returned should be the guesser.

*Explain how to see that nobody could disprove the suggestion when nobody can disprove the suggestion.

Make a guess that has the 3 cards in the envelope.
