Open the Game class and run the program. Click on "Start Game!" 
Miss Scarlet's cards will appear in the middle of the right panel of the window. 
Once you roll and end your turn, the program will show the cards in the next player's (Colonel Mustard) hand.
When you start the game, take a look at the Console. The cards for each player will have been printed here, as well
as the cards of the envelope. There will be no duplicate cards and you can verify that 21 total cards have been dealt 
(three to the envelope and 3 to each of the 6 players).
